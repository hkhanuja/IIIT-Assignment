# IIIT Assigment 1

During my fellowship at IIIT Hyderabad, we were given our first assigment related to dimensionality reduction. I implemented various dimensionality reduction methods on three different datasets and analyzed the performance of each of them qualitatively and quantitatively. I also impleted t-SNE and K nearest neighbours methods to display the high dimensionality images in two dimensions to easily visualize if there are clusters forming for each class. The code and the report are attached.
